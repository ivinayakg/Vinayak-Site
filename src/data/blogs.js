    description: "Sometimes you just sit around doing nothing and this thought just comes to knock your head at the back that life is just so beautiful even after that you are broken from the inside, have a sense of emptiness and loneliness, you should probably stop and give up on life but if you have just a single drop of hope in your heart for a better tomorrow then you can look past all your inadequacies and still would be able to see how beautiful the world is. The single fact that my action will always change who I would be in the future is just so inspiring to me. In the time of crisis, this is the single most important as well as difficult thing to do and that is taking 100% responsibility that everything that is happening in your life is because of you. Will make you so small but will give you the power to make a different decision and therefore a different life. We all want to be special but why? what is that being special is going to give us that not being doesn't or is there even something we need or it's just something we think we NEED?",
